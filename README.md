# oeliv
Open Extensible Live Interface Visualizer

Oeliv is a work in progress. Currently its not ready for even development or playground usage.

The plan for Oeliv is to allow it to easily be extended to support new frameworks.


So... What is Oeliv?

Oeliv is a visual user interface debugger. Like the Designer mode in Visual Studio or Android Studio. It will show you a preview of the user interface you are building. Then it will listen over a server for commands about what to show for visual debugging. The ultimate goal here is to have a tool that can be used in ANY Ide to create WPF, Dart, Flutter, Xamarin, Etc.. User Interfaces.

Want to use NVIM but you're working on a WPF app? Oeliv should be your go to solution.

Right now oeliv is in the planning stage. But i'm rapidly approaching a first prototype for the base engine as well as for the first WPF plugin.
